vyatta-tinc (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reordered show commads `show tinc NETWORK <logging|statistics|connections>`
    seems more natural than `show tinc <logging|statistics|connections> NETWORK`
  * Added "all" option to `show tinc <> logging` to allow showing all matching
    logs for the given network and not just the current process.
  * Added support for attaching firewall rules to networks
  * Added support for proxy settings (The settings used for proxies have changed,
    so any config that was created for the old non-working proxy settings won't
    be valid.
  * Added support for all tinc scripts
